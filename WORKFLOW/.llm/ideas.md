I-0001 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0002 | Drift prevention by mandatory revision discipline and log chain | Basis for workflowkit hardening

I-0002 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0003 | Require explicit code-change mapping by Q-ID with compact log rows | Enables traceability without heavy I/O
I-0003 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0004 | Build SHINON Indirect Economy OS MVP end-to-end with deterministic kernel + sim + persistence + tests | Full bootstrap from governance to executable project
I-0004 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0005 | Add a requirements file for simple dependency installation in PROJECT | Improve onboarding and reproducible setup
I-0005 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0006 | Rebrand project identity to Shinon Alpha World after dependency install and successful test run | Align repository naming with requested product direction
I-0006 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0007 | Make the WorkflowKit repository contain the full project artifacts (WORKFLOW + PROJECT) | Ensure repository itself is the project deliverable
I-0007 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0008 | Massive UI overhaul: fixed OS boot sequence + chat-first interaction + modular UI adapter | Preserve deterministic core while modernizing UX without menu-driven flow
I-0008 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0016 | Restore strict top-level split (WORKFLOW for governance, PROJECT for code/data) and add user-readable workflow output docs | Remove duplicate structure drift and improve maintainability
I-0009 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0017 | Make requirements.txt represent a full setup so one install command brings all dependencies | Prevent partial installs and ensure predictable first run
I-0010 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0018 | Fix Textual runtime compatibility and improve terminal readability defaults | Remove crash on launch with current textual version and reduce display friction
I-0011 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0019 | Add one-step setup/start scripts for non-technical users | Reduce onboarding friction and avoid Python-specific manual steps
I-0012 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0020 | Enforce clean isolated environment by default on each setup run | Prevent hidden state drift from previous local installs
I-0013 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0021 | Enforce symbol-level workflow traceability and machine-checkable audits with locked dependencies | Prevent incomplete change documentation and dependency drift regressions
I-0014 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0022 | Guarantee project runtime independence from .llm and auto-export session transcripts to user docs | Ensure fresh-system operability and persistent operator trace outside repository writes
I-0015 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0023 | Decouple transcripts from SHINON runtime and manage Copilot/ChatGPT transcripts as a separate workflow tool | Keep PROJECT domain-pure while preserving full session documentation outside app runtime
I-0016 | 2026-02-18 | CP-0024 | Add DE/EN runtime localization with unlock/collapse gameplay loop extensions and standalone locale-safe workflow export | Deliver gameplay depth while preserving monorepo and standalone audit guarantees
